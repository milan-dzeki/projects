User can choose one or more pizzas among offered ones, or he can use mini 'pizza maker app', to create it's own pizza and order it. To order, and see these orders, signing up is required, which is being managed via Firebase. Due to simplicity, any random email address and password can be used to sign up. Also, there is a possibility for logging in with used email and password.",tech:"Website is made with React, with React Router Dom for multiple-page feel.
